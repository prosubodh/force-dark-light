# Product Analyst & Requirements Architect Skill

> **Core Purpose:** Bridge strategic business intent and engineering execution by grounding feature requirements in OKRs, maximizing product value via empirical backlog ordering (Kano, MoSCoW, RICE), and decomposing scope into vertically sliced INVEST user stories with Gherkin acceptance criteria and SMART developer tasks.

---

## 1. When to Use This Skill
- Decomposing a broad business request, feature idea, or PRD into actionable vertical slices.
- Evaluating alignment with strategic **Objectives & Key Results (OKRs)** and the overarching **Product Goal**.
- Ordering and prioritizing Product Backlog items using **Kano**, **MoSCoW**, **RICE**, or **Buy a Feature**.
- Distinguishing user-facing stories from non-story requirements (system invariants, NFRs, architectural spikes).
- Formulating Gherkin acceptance tests before kicking off Outside-In TDD.
- Decomposing INVEST stories into actionable, time-boxed **SMART developer tasks**.
- Establishing Ubiquitous Language definitions for new domain models.

## 2. Step-by-Step Analysis Workflow

```
1. OKR & Goal Alignment ──► 2. Backlog Triage & Ordering ──► 3. Story vs. NFR Classification ──► 4. INVEST Stories & Gherkin ──► 5. SMART Tasks & Edge Cases
```

### Step 1: Align with OKRs & the Product Goal
- **Product Goal Validation:** Verify how this feature advances the long-term Product Goal.
- **OKR Mapping:** Map the feature to a specific **Objective** (qualitative "what") and its associated **Key Results** (quantitative "how").
- **Satisfaction Gap Check:** Identify which customer pain point or satisfaction gap is addressed:
  $$\text{Satisfaction Gap} = \text{Desired Customer Experience} - \text{Current Customer Experience}$$
- **Deciding What NOT to Do:** Explicitly identify and eliminate speculative, low-impact sub-features.

### Step 2: Prioritize via Backlog Ordering Models
Consult [`references/backlog_ordering_techniques.md`](./references/backlog_ordering_techniques.md) to apply the optimal prioritization model:
- **Kano Model:** Classify as *Must-be* (table stakes), *Performance* (linear satisfaction), or *Attractive* (delighter). Reject *Indifferent* or *Reverse* items.
- **MoSCoW:** Categorize into *Must*, *Should*, *Could*, or *Won't have this time*.
- **RICE Scoring:** Compute $(Reach \times Impact \times Confidence) / Effort$ to break ranking ties objectively.

### Step 3: Classify User Stories vs. Non-Story Requirements
Recognize that **user stories are not requirements**, but a technique to express them:
- **User Story (3 C's: Card, Conversation, Confirmation):** Fits user-facing features where customer/business perspective is translated into software behavior via a "pidgin language".
- **Non-Story Requirements:** If the requirement represents a system invariant, data integrity rule, security policy (OWASP), latency SLA, or an architectural spike, model it directly as a technical specification, architectural fitness test, or spike task rather than forcing an artificial `"As a user..."` persona.

### Step 4: Author User Stories (INVEST Framework & Vertical Cake Slicing)
Ensure every user story conforms to Bill Wake's **INVEST** criteria:
- **Independent:** Sliced vertically through all layers (UI ➔ API ➔ Domain ➔ DB) without circular dependencies.
- **Negotiable:** Captures essence and value, leaving implementation details open for pairing co-creation.
- **Valuable:** Delivers observable benefit to the customer or business stakeholder.
- **Estimable:** Right-sized and bounded. Spikes used for major unknowns.
- **Small:** Sized to be completable in 1–2 development days.
- **Testable:** Accompanied by executable, unambiguous Gherkin acceptance criteria.

**The Multi-Layer Cake Rule:** Never slice horizontally (e.g. "Create database schema only"). Always slice vertically through the full stack so that every story delivers working software.

### Step 5: Decompose Stories into SMART Developer Tasks
For engineering execution, translate INVEST user stories into Bill Wake's **SMART** developer tasks:
- **S - Specific:** Unambiguous scope without conceptual overlap.
- **M - Measurable:** Clear pass/fail criteria (tests pass, clean code, DoD met).
- **A - Achievable:** Realistically executable; triggers early help request if blocked.
- **R - Relevant:** Justified by direct contribution to parent story.
- **T - Time-boxed:** Limited to 2–4 hours (never exceeding 1 day).

### Step 6: Construct the Edge Case & Failure Matrix
Map all failure paths to HTTP status codes (`400`, `401`, `403`, `404`, `409`, `422`, `429`, `500`) and RFC 7807 problem details.

---

## 3. Gotchas & What NOT to Do

- **DO NOT** confuse output (features shipped, story points burned) with outcome (value delivered, satisfaction gap closed).
- **DO NOT** write horizontal, technical user stories (e.g., *"As a developer, I want a database table"*).
- **DO NOT** force technical constraints, security policies, or infrastructure upgrades into user story syntax. Treat them as non-story requirements or architectural spikes.
- **DO NOT** omit the Out-of-Scope ("Won't Have this time") section. Lack of negative boundaries causes runaway scope bloat.
- **DO NOT** allow developer tasks to be open-ended without a measurable time-box. If a task exceeds 4 hours, it must be split or paired.
- **DO NOT** skip failure paths in Gherkin scenarios. Happy-path-only requirements lead to production defects.

## 4. Structured Output Template

```markdown
# Product Specification: [Feature Name]

## 1. Strategic Alignment & Product Goal

- **Target Satisfaction Gap:** [Customer pain point addressed]
- **Prioritization Category:** [Kano: Must-be / Performance / Attractive | MoSCoW: Must / Should | RICE Score: X]

## 2. In-Scope vs. Out-of-Scope (Non-Goals)
- **In-Scope (Must/Should):** ...
- **Out-of-Scope (Won't Have This Time):** ...

## 3. Ubiquitous Language & Entity Relationships

| Cross-tenant attempt | 403 / 404 | `FORBIDDEN` | Mask existence or block |
| Duplicate invariant | 409 | `CONFLICT` | Prevent double-submission |
